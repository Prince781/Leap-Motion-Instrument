Leap Motion Instrument
======================

Made by Ben Iofel, David Maginley, and Princeton Ferro

To run this in eclipse, you need the Leap Motion and the Leap Motion program for
your OS. Make a new project, click next, and add an external jar in the
Libraries tab. Select LeapLibrary0.7.4/*yourOS*/LeapJava.jar. Expand the jar and
edit the native libraries. On Mac OS X select the LeapLibrary0.7.4/Mac/ folder.
On Windows, select the LeapLibrary0.7.4/Windows/*your_architecture* folder. Now
click finish. Then just import the two java files and run it alongside the Leap
program for your OS (not provided).
